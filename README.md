# aRtsyGameJam

This is a project by Nick Ballou (https://nickballou.com/) and Elena Petrovskaya (elenapetrovskaya.com) to create a generative art app in Shiny.  It is heavily based on the aRtsy R package by Koen Derks (https://github.com/koenderks/aRtsy). Essentially, we wanted to take this package and create an app that would be easily accessible to people who might not have much knowledge of R. In the process, we also made some tweaks/additions to the generator parameters. 

To run the app, run the 'app.R' file locally. Make sure you have all the other files downloaded too, as some helper functions and dependencies are included in there which the main file will not run without. Once the app is running, there are additional explanations within if you need them (although hopefully it will be intuitive!)
